PartsBasedDetector
This project implements a Parts Based Detector in C++, described in the
following paper by Deva Ramanan:

    Yi Yang, Deva Ramanan, "Articulated Pose Estimation with 
    Flexible Mixtures-of-Parts," CVPR 2011

The project has the following dependencies:

    OpenCV  REQUIRED (for image processing)
    CMake   REQUIRED (for building)
    Doxygen OPTIONAL (for documentation)
    OpenMP  OPTIONAL (for multithreading)
    CUDA    OPTIONAL (for GPU accelerated support)

The project can be built in one of two modes:

    A standalone binary (for testing functionality)
    A shared library    (for use in existing applications)

To configure the project, set the options at the top of CMakeLists.txt
To build the project, follow the normal cmake routine from the root folder:

    >> mkdir build
    >> cd build
    >> cmake ..
    >> make
