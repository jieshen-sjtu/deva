 1) Detection thresholds can be changed in the xml file between the <thresh>
 tags

 2) The models can be found at
 https://github.com/hbristow/PartsBasedDetectorModels (which is a submodule of
 PartsBasedDetector if you git clone recursively)

 3) The conversion code for transferring between a Face -> Pose model is in the
 matlab subdirectory of PartsBasedDetector, and if you build with cvmatio
 support, it'll also build a utility called ModelTransfer which will convert
 .mat -> .xml
